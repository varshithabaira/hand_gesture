Project Title: Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition Game using MediaPipe & Machine Learning
 I'm excited to announce my real-time hand gesture recognition gameâ€”a fun and interactive AI-based Rock-Paper-Scissors system that works entirely through live webcam input and gesture classification.
*Key Highlights:
MediaPipe used for accurate, real-time hand landmark detection.
Built a custom gesture dataset and trained a Random Forest classifier.
Developed a multiplayer interface using OpenCV and Python multiprocessing for parallel gesture recognition.
Real-time predictions, gesture-specific feedback, and live scoring all displayed on-screen.
How It Works:
Two players perform hand gestures in front of their webcams.
The system detects and preprocesses hand landmarks.
A trained model classifies each gesture as Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
The winner is decided based on game logic, and scores are updated in real time.
Gratitude to my mentor Lakshmi Teja Illuri and trainer SAXON K SHA for your continuous guidance, support, and motivation throughout this journey.
